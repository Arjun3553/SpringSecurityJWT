# Spring Security with JWT

Spring Security with JWT is a tool that helps developers securely authenticate and authorize users in their Spring Boot applications using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a secure way to send information between parties as a JSON object. This project is for developers who want to implement secure user access management in their Spring Boot applications using JWTs. With this project, developers can easily integrate JWT-based authentication and authorization into their applications, creating a secure and scalable solution for managing user access to resources.
